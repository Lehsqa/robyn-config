# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We support the latest released version of `robyn-config`. The tool requires Python >=3.11,<4.0. Please update to the most recent release before reporting issues.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

1. **Do not open a public issue.**  
2. Open a private security advisory on GitHub (Security ▸ Report a vulnerability) for the `Lehsqa/robyn-config` repository.  
3. Include:
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Impact assessment (who/what is affected)
   - Suggested mitigation, if known
   - Environment details (OS, Python version, robyn-config version)
4. If you cannot use GitHub advisories, create a private issue with minimal reproduction steps and mark it as security-related.

We aim to acknowledge reports within 5 business days and will keep you informed of progress and timelines. Patches will be released as soon as a fix is validated. Thank you for helping keep the project secure.
